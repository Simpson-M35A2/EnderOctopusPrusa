Ender 5 Plus / BTT Octopus 1.1 board / Pursa MK3S+ Extruder

***Work In Progress***

Pushing the limits of my ender In a way I haven't seen anyone else try. This will end up with the stl/3mf files to try this mod out for yourself.
Feel free to use my code as a guide to help get your btt octopus working but know not everything is going to be exact for your printer.

Also I appreciate any help you can offer to make this better.
